## 2. Extracting Indices of a Logical Vector

As you learnt earlier, a logical vector has `TRUE` or `FALSE` elements. 

You can find out the indices of the `TRUE` elements using the `which()` function. 

For `lvct = [TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE]`, `which(lvct)` would print `1 2 4` since those elements are `TRUE` and satisfy the logical condition you had defined. 

For this exercise, you will repeat the instructions from the previous exercise, and use the `which()` function to print the indices for the elements that satisfy the condition. 

*** =instructions
- In an object `weight_rate`, store `women$weight`/ `women$height` 
- Create a logical vector `low` for the condition `weight_rate < 2`
- Use `which()` to determine the indices of `weight_rate` associated with values lower than 2

*** =hint


*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(women)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(datasets)
data(women)

# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`


# Store the `weight_rate < 2` in `low`


# Use `which(low)`, to get the lowest value


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`
weight_rate<-women$weight/women$height

# Store the `weight_rate < 2` in `low`
low <- weight_rate < 2

# Use `which(low)`, to get the lowest value
which(low)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("weight_rate", undefined_msg = "Define the weight rate first!", incorrect_msg = "Check the formula.")
test_object("low", undefined_msg = "Define low!", incorrect_msg = "It should be weight rates less than 2.")
test_function("which", incorrect_msg = "Use the command from the instructions.")
success_msg("Awesome!")
```

## 3. Extracting values of a Vector from Indices

Now that you have learnt how to extract the indices of a vector that meet a logical condition, you can access the values of the original vector for those particular indices using square brackets `[]`. 

For example: `food$cost[low]`, would give us the cost of food lower than 1 (assuming `low <- food$cost < 1`)

For this exercise, you will work with the `women` dataset, repeat the instructions from the previous exercise, and retrieve the values of `women$height` that meet the logical condition `weight_rate < 2`. 


*** =instructions
- In an object `weight_rate`, store `women$weight`/ `women$height` 
- Create a logical vector `low` for the condition `weight_rate < 2`
- Use square brackets to retrieve the heights of those women meeting the logical condition



*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(women)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(datasets)
data(women)

# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`


# Store the `weight_rate < 2` in `low`


# Heights of women with weight rates lower than 2


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`
weight_rate<-women$weight/women$height

# Store the `weight_rate < 2` in `low`
low <- weight_rate < 2

# Height of women with weight rates lower than 2
women$height[low]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("weight_rate", undefined_msg = "Define the weight rate first!", incorrect_msg = "Check the formula.")
test_object("low", undefined_msg = "Define low!", incorrect_msg = "Same as last question.")
test_output_contains("women$height[low]", incorrect_msg = "Follow code from example given!")
success_msg("Good job!")
```

## 4. Combining logical conditions

You can also combine logical conditions using the `&` operator. This helps you extract values of a dataset that satisfy more than one logical condition. 

For example, `index <- low & food$courses=="Desserts"`, would store the indices of the `food` dataset that satisfies the condition defined by `low` and also has `Desserts` in the `food$courses` column. 

For this exercise, you will extend the code from the previous exercises to combine 2 logical conditions: Weight rate < 2 and Women with height = 60 inches. 

*** =instructions

- In an object `ind`, store the indices of `women` dataset that satisfy `low` and `women$height==59` 
- Print the `women$weight` corresponding to those indices 


*** =hint
Use the previously defined logical vector low and the logical operator &.


*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(women)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(datasets)
data(women)

# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`
weight_rate<-women$weight/women$height

# Store the `weight_rate < 2` in `low`
low <- weight_rate < 2

# Store indices in 'ind' that satisfy height=59in and weight rates lower than 2


# Get weight of that entry


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`
weight_rate<-women$weight/women$height

# Store the `weight_rate < 2` in `low`
low <- weight_rate < 2

# Store indices in 'ind' that satisfy height=59in and weight rates lower than 2
ind <- low & women$height==59

# Get weight of that entry
women$weight[ind]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("ind", undefined_msg = "Make sure to define ind first!", incorrect_msg = "Check code.")
test_output_contains("women$weight[ind]", incorrect_msg = "Use [] to retrieve names.")
success_msg("Wasn`t that good! Let`s move to the next one.")
```

## 5. Operations on Logical Conditions

Since a logical condition returns a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values, you can perform simple arithmetic operations on this vector. For this purpose, R considers the `TRUE` values as `1` and `FALSE` values as `0`. 
For example, you could use the `sum()` function to calculate the number of elements meeting the logical condition. 

For this exercise, you will work with the `women` dataset, and calculate the number of women whose `weight_rate` is greater than the average `weight_rate`.  

*** =instructions
- In an object `avg`, store the the mean of `weight_rate` using `mean()` function
- Find the number of women with `weight_rate` greater than the `avg` 

*** =hint

Use the `sum()` function with the logical condition 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(women)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(datasets)
data(women)

# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`
weight_rate<-women$weight/women$height


# Compute average weight rate and store in `avg` using the function `mean`

# How many women are > avg ? Check using `sum`

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the weight rate for each tree, in `weight_rate`
weight_rate<-women$weight/women$height

# Compute average weight rate and store in `avg` using the function `mean`
avg <-mean(weight_rate)

# How many women are > avg ? Check using sum
sum(weight_rate > avg)

```


*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("avg", undefined_msg = "Define avg first.", incorrect_msg = "Compute the mean and store it here.")
test_function("sum", incorrect_msg = "Check the number of women above average weight rate.")
success_msg("Awesome!")
```

## 6. Match
You will use the `murders` dataset for the next three exercises.

Sometimes, you might want to check if a larger vector has elements that are also present in a smaller vector. 

The `match()` function takes 2 vectors as arguments and gives the index numbers of elements in the vector of interest that match the given vector. 

You can then use the indices with `[]` to access the other data corresponding to the matched elements.

In this exercise, you want to find out the state names in the `murder` dataset for a given set of abbreviations "NH", "OH" and "TN". You will use the `match()` function to achieve this. 

*** =instructions
- Create an object `abbs` and store the abbreviations "NH", "OH"and "TN"
- In an object `ind`, store the results of matching `abbs` with `murders$abb`
- Use `[]` and `ind` to extract the `murders$state` values corresponding to the abbreviations 

*** =hint
As an example, `match(x, y)` finds the index values of `y` that match with `x`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```


*** =sample_code
```{r}

# Store the 3 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors)

# Match the abbs to the murders$abb and store in `ind`

# Extract and print state names with matching state abbreviations


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the 3 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors)
abbs <- c("NH", "OH", "TN")

# Match the abbs to the murders$abb and store in `ind`
ind <- match(abbs , murders$abb)

# Extract and print state names with matching state abbreviations
murders$state[ind]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("abbs", undefined_msg = "Define abbs!", incorrect_msg = "Check the abbreviations stored.")
test_object("ind", undefined_msg = "Define ind!", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to use the match function ")
test_output_contains("murders$state[ind]", incorrect_msg = "Use square brackets.")
success_msg("Awesome!")
```

## 7. %in%

If, instead of a vector of index numbers, you want a logical vector that tells you whether or not each element of a vector is in another vector, you can use the operator `%in%`. 

Note: The true state abbreviations are stored in `murders$abb`.

*** =instructions
- In an object `abbs`, store the character vector with abbreviations "ND", "NE", "NM", "NN", "NY"
- Use the `%in%` operator to create and print a logical vector that compares `abbs` and `murders$abb` dataset

*** =hint
Use code `abbs%in%murders$abb`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

# Store the 5 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors)


# Use the %in% command


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the 5 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors)
abbs <- c("ND", "NE", "NM", "NN", "NY")

# Use the %in% command
abbs%in%murders$abb

```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("abbs", undefined_msg = "Define abbs!", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to store the 5 abbreviations in abbs.")
test_output_contains("abbs%in%murders$abb", incorrect_msg = "Check the code. ")
success_msg("Awesome!")
```

## 8. Negation operator 

In the previous exercise you created a logical vector indicating whether the character strings "ND", "NE", "NM", "NN", "NY" are actual state abbreviations in `murders`. 

You can use the negation operator `!` to reverse the above operation. That is, in this example, to find the abbreviation that is not part of the larger vector `murders$abb`.   

Note: The true state abbreviations are stored in `murders$abb`.


*** =instructions
- Create a character vector `abbs` with elements "ND", "NE", "NM", "NN", "NY"
- In an object `ind`, store the index of the element in `abbs` not present in `murders$abb` using `which()` function and `!` operator
- Print the values of `abbs` corresponding to `ind` using `[]`


*** =hint
Use the code `ind <- which(!abbs%in%murders$abb)`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

# Store the 5 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors)


# Use the `which` command and `!` operator to find out which abbreviation is not actually part of the dataset and store in 'ind'


# Names of abbs in `ind`



```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the 5 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors)
abbs <- c("ND", "NE", "NM", "NN", "NY")

# Use the `which` command and `!` operator to find out which abbreviation is not actually part of the dataset and store in 'ind'
ind <- which(!abbs%in%murders$abb)

# Names of abbs in `ind`
abbs[ind]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("abbs", undefined_msg = "Define abbs!", incorrect_msg = "Check the 5 abbreviations from the instructions.")
test_object("ind", undefined_msg = "Make sure you define ind first! ", incorrect_msg = "Use the which and ! codes." )
test_output_contains("abbs[ind]", incorrect_msg = "Have you used square brackets?")
success_msg("Awesome!")
```
