## 1. Scatterplot

In this chapter, you will practice using basic plotting tools in R. 

You will use the same dataset as we did in the chapter on `Sorting` - `RatPupWeight`.

The `plot(<x axis>,<y axis>)` function generates a scatter plot of 2 variables, the first variable across the x-axis and the second variable across the y-axis. 

For example, `plot(time, height)` plots `time` variable on the x-axis and `height` variable on y-axis. 

*** =instructions
- In `weight`, store the rats' weights `RatPupWeight$weight`
- In `lsize`, store the number of pups per litter `RatPupWeight$Lsize`
- Create a scatterplot of the weights of the ratpups (on x-axis) with the size of the litter they were born in (on y-axis)

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(nlme)
data(RatPupWeight)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(nlme)
data(RatPupWeight)

# Store the values of `weight` and `lsize`



# Create a scatterplot with `weight` and `lsize`

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the values of `weight` and `lsize`
weight <- RatPupWeight$weight
lsize <- RatPupWeight$Lsize

# Create a scatterplot with `weight` and `lsize`
plot(weight, lsize)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("weight", undefined_msg = "Define weight first.", incorrect_msg = "Store the value of weight.")
test_object("lsize", undefined_msg = "Define lsize first.", incorrect_msg = "Store the lsize.")
test_function("plot", incorrect_msg = "Scatter weight on lsize.")
success_msg("Doesn't that plot look neat!")
```

## 2. Histogram

A histogram helps you visualize the number of occurences of a range of data. 

In R, you can plot the histogram of a variable using the `hist()` function. It takes the variable as its argument. 

*** =instructions
- In `weight`, store the rats' weights `RatPupWeight$weight`
- Plot the histogram of `weight`

*** =hint


*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(nlme)
data(RatPupWeight)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(nlme)
data(RatPupWeight)

# Store the value of `weight` (same as previous question)


# Create a histogram of the weight


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the value of `weight` (same as previous question)
weight <- RatPupWeight$weight

# Create a histogram of the weight
hist(weight)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("weight", undefined_msg = "Define weight first.", incorrect_msg = "Check code!")
test_function("hist", incorrect_msg = "Check code again.")
success_msg("You've got a histogram! Awesome!")
```

## 3. Boxplot

A boxplot helps you graphically visualize the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum in a given dataset. 

The y-axis variable is continuous (eg: weight which can take a range of values) while the x-axis variable is discrete (eg: gender which takes 2 values - male, female). 

The syntax of boxplot is `boxplot(y~x, dataset = <Name of the dataset>)`. 

For example, `boxplot(rain~region, dataset = Weather)` plots the boxplot `rain` on y-axis for different values of `region` on x-axis in the `Weather` dataset. 

*** =instructions
Generate boxplots of the weights of the pups by sex (`weight~sex`), using one line of code.  
- In `weight`, store the rats' weights `RatPupWeight$weight`
- In `sex`, store the rats' sex `RatPupWeight$sex`
- Plot the boxplot of `weight` of pups by their `sex`, specifying the dataset

*** =hint
```{r}
Make sure you specify the dataset.
```

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# Load the datasets
library(nlme)
data(RatPupWeight)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Store values as in previous questions


# Create a boxplot of weight by sex and specify the dataset

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store values as in previous questions
weight <- RatPupWeight$weight
sex <- RatPupWeight$sex

# Create a boxplot of weight by sex and specify the dataset
boxplot(weight~sex, dataset = RatPupWeight)

```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_function("boxplot", incorrect_msg = "Check code. use ~ sign and include dataset.")
success_msg("Great job! Now you've learnt all three basic types of plots in R!")
```
